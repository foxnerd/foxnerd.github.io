### The Story
The Mouse with the Question Mark Tail is a very extremely good book. It is sad and happy at the same time. From the beginning of the book to the end. But, it is written in old english, so you would get this for a nine year old and up. Now i should tell you about the main character, a young mouse with a question mark tail, that lives under a horse barn, in a town named Muse and goes on an amazing adventure!
